The train screeches as it goes around a curve. She doesn't notice
though. She's too absorbed in her knitting. She doesn't even look up.
She knows there's nothing to see on the crowded train car except other
people's asses. She's lucky that her office is close to the beginning of
the train line, it means she can get usually get a seat before the train
loads up with other passengers. At least on the trip home, like right
now.

She peers through her thick-framed glasses at the project she is working
on. The yarn slips over her finger and back around the needle. The
needles click quietly as she moves them. She loops the yarn over and
then tilts the points around to get through the next stitch. Oddly, she
can hear the clicks of the needles even with the train screeching. Or
maybe she just feels the clicks through the bones of her fingers and her
mind interprets the sensation as sound.

A chart rests in her lap, filled from one corner to the other with the
strange hieroglyphs of her craft. She stops occasionally to run her
finger along a line in the chart, and moves a glowing yellow sticky
note down a line to mark which row she's on before resuming her needle
clicks.

She might be knitting a sock. It's a warm yellow color, with a pattern
of dark ink-blue stripes waving across it. But an experienced knitter
would recognize the tube extending down from her needles is too narrow
for an adult sock and too long for a baby sock. An experienced knitter
would also realize that while she knits with a speed indicating a
certain level of expertise, there's only one tube on the needles — if
it were socks, there would be two. An experienced knitter would probably
be a little puzzled what exactly it is that she's knitting. But there
are no experienced knitters on this train car today.

The train screeches around another curve, and this one she instinctively
knows is the one before her stop. As it pulls into the station, she
leans along with the rest of the other passengers when the forward
momentum comes off the train before it comes off the people and they
are all set back upright. She hops to her feet and squeezes among the
others getting off the crowded car at her stop. Up the stairs, into the
little station, and a cute boy with dark hair holds the door for her as
she comes out of the station. She smiles her smile that cracks on one
side of her mouth before the other, but she looks down quickly, her soft
brown curls falling around her face. She walks quickly past him, with a
quiet thanks, and proceeds down the sidewalk towards her home.

She knits as she walks, her eyes down, watching her stitches pass in
front of the steps of her feet. She knows the chart well enough for this
simple project that she doesn't need it for the moment. It is almost
done, and she thinks she might be binding off before she gets in her
door. Knitting and walking at the same time slows down her pace, but
it's such a lovely spring day she doesn't mind walking slow.

Her home is the ground floor apartment of a small two story house. It
might be small, but it's cute. Her upstairs neighbors have planted
tulips in the little patch of front yard and they are coming up. If they
had asked her, she would have chosen a more plain native groundcover
plant for the front yard, like a sedge, but the tulips are colorful and
pleasant as they always, inevitably are.

She unlocks her door and grabs her mail sticking in the mail slot,
holding her knitting in one hand. She plops down on the wood-framed
couch and throws the mail on the glass coffee table.

Her cat with his one odd blue eye jumps on the couch next to her. She
slips the tips of her fingers over his head behind his ears and he
leans into her touch. She pets him for a minute, before picking up
her knitting again, and finishing the bind-off of her strange little
project. She tosses it over on top of the mail and stands, taking off
her jacket and hanging it on the wood-ball coat hooks she has installed
on the wall. She unbuttons her her blouse with it's tight houndstooth
pattern and pulls it off her shoulders and tosses it on the back of
the couch. She's wearing a simple black bra, that hugs her small pert
breasts against her in a cozy way.

Picking up her knit tube again she goes into her bedroom and flops back
on the bed. Her cat is again under her hand, and she absentmindedly
stares at the ceiling as she scratches his head. He purrs his love for
her. Her other hand rests on her stomach, her finger taps against the
button of her jeans as she thinks whispy thoughts to herself.

After a few minutes of quiet mindlessness, she stretches her non-cat
hand up and opens the drawer of her bedside stand and pulls out her
vibrator. She holds it out in front of her, and squeezes the on button.
Its little LED light comes on and it moves in her hand like some angry
insect. It's an unnatural shade of cool blue, made of silicone — that
smooth-sticky texture that is supposed to be both antiseptic and warm.
At least that's what the sex-toy marketers seem to have convinced their
customers.

She's never really been convinced. She doesn't dislike this vibrator; it
works as well as any she's ever used, and she's certainly gotten plenty
of use out of it. But silicone always seemed cold and machine-like to
her. And the blue shade reminds her of something one might find in a
hospital drawer. The knitter's sense in her felt it needed to be more
comfortable. That's why she knitted the cozy for it, which she slips
over it now, watching the yellow tube of stitching expand around the
bulk of her frigid blue vibrator.

Ensconced in its fuzzy yellow sleeve, the vibrator hums more softly.
Instead of an angry insect, now it reminds her of someone who hums
quietly while they concentrate on their work. She likes the way the yarn
engulfs the bulb of her little vibrator. She slides the cozy along the
length of it, scrunching it up, and the head peeps out one end looking
for all the world like the vibrator has a miniature turtle-neck on. She
smiles to herself, pleased with her work, not least for the silliness
of it. She clicks off the vibrator and drops it on the bed next to her,
scaring the cat, who launches off to the safety of the floor.

She stands, leans over, and closes the shades to her windows. In the
dimness of the room she undoes the button of her jeans, and unzips them.
She loops her thumbs over the waist, taking the edge of her panties with
them, and falls back on the bed, slipping her pants under her ass, and
down the length of her long legs. She kicks the bundle off her ankles,
and it falls to the floor, scaring the cat again.

Her legs slowly spread wide as her knees come up and she puts her feet
flat on the bed. She still wears her black bra snuggling her breasts.

She holds the encozied vibrator in her left hand, and presses the
recessed button with her thumb to turn it back on. It buzzes in her
grip, the knitted cozy soft and fuzzy against the palm of her hand and
the inside of her fingers, like a warm and affectionate pet. But it
quakes with such energy, it's more like an affection pet who can't wait
for its person to come home and play with it.

Her right hand rests lightly on her naked thigh. She slips her finger
down so the tips are passing along the inside of that sensitive soft
skin between her legs. She brings her fingers slowly up until the tips
of her middle and forefingers are brushing against the lips of her
pussy. The cute dark-haired boy in the train station flops lazily into
her mind like someone dropping into a cushy armchair, and she feels her
pussy dampen immediately against her finger.

It never took very much for her. The tiniest gesture by some attractive
boy (and occasionally an adorable lady) would spin and spin in her
head, like a top of lust had been set going inside her. On any day such
a gesture occurred, it was like the string of the top had been yanked
with as much force as possible, the way a small boy would. And it would
slowly wind down over the course of a few days. Eventually another top
would be spun, usually by someone else. She always seemed to be too shy
to pursue the same person yanking her top-string twice.

That dark-haired boy had been extra cute, from what quick glance she
actually caught of him. She imagines him now, standing over her, his
hand touching her pussy instead of her own. She lets out a long slow
breath, and presses the tips of her fingers into her wet pussy and
slides them up and over her clit. Warm lust spreads up her back and
through her shoulders.

She passes the vibrator in its cozy to her right hand, and makes sure
the tip is still sticking out from its little turtle-neck collar. She
smiles again, touches the shaking tip to her belly, and slowly inches
it down, through her light brown patch and over her clit. She holds
the vibrator vertically in her hand, her pinky extending down, three
fingers gripping it around the cozy-covered part of the shaft, opposing
her thumb on the other side. The exposed tip dips down and rocks gently
against her clit. She breathes faster now, letting out long gasps. She
closes her eyes and arches her long neck back. An orgasm approaches
quickly. She feels it foreshortened, fast, and powerful as it comes,
like the Doppler affect on the whistle of a train.

It arrives with the kind of sudden rush of a train passing too. She's
used to that, her orgasms have always been intense. Her pussy rises
on a tide of wetness with her orgasm, and she can hear the tip of the
vibrator wetly buzzing against herself.

It is at this moment, when her orgasm is flowing past her, when she is
wettest, when her legs shake with the pleasure of being touched by the
vision of the dark-haired boy in her head, that she has the sensation
of the cozy twisting in her hand, the loops of yarn slipping quickly
between her fingers.

Not twisting like she let it get out of her control, but twisting as
if the vibrator was trying to express some kind of will of its own in
response to her orgasm. As if it _wanted_ to fuck her.

No wait — that wasn't it either. It was as if the _cozy_ had twisted the
vibrator against her. As if the cozy was using the vibrator on her, not
her using the vibrator on herself.

This sensation shocks her, and her eyes pop open.

"What an odd thing!" she thinks to herself.

Perhaps she was so taken by her orgasm that she had hallucinated
slightly. She closes her legs around the still-humming vibrator and
rolls to her side, and breathes slowly and deeply.

She doesn't want to let the pleasure of her orgasm go. At the same time,
that twisting movement was such a strange, creepy sensation. The cozy
shakes softly between her thighs. The tip is still lightly touching her
clit. She knows another orgasm will not be too hard to find. She rolls
onto her back again, and lets her knees drift apart.

"Well," she thinks out loud, "if its so good that I'm hallucinating,
maybe that's not something I should avoid. I will boldly adventure into
new territories!"

She resigns herself to be open to whatever strange pleasures she might
be able to derive from the world. Especially if those new experiences
don't require her to interact with other people.

She pushes the little exposed head of her vibrator up against her clit
again. She lets out another long breath and almost immediately feels
another orgasm approaching. The machine hums, smacking wetly against her
pussy. Her legs start shaking, almost in sync with the oscillations of
the vibrator.

And this time she is sure she feels the twist. The cozy wrings itself in
her hand, pushes and pulls against her fingers. The vibrator spins three
quarters of the way around and turns at an angle, and plunges into her
pussy with a long piercing stroke.

A small scream that melds terror with pleasure escapes from her. She
wraps her fingers tightly around the cozy, and grips it with all her
strength. The small muscles of her forearm tighten as she tries to pull
the vibrator and cozy from between her legs. Under her fingers she can
feel all the stitches of the cozy pulling themselves taught, with a will
of their own. The cozy bunches in her hand — and against her effort to
pull it away from her pussy — the cozy squirms and pushes the vibrator
deeper into her.

Her free hand moves to her head and covers her eyes. She's breathing
heavily.

"Oh my god."

She says out loud.

"This is so weird! Did someone drug me?"

In her regular masturbation sessions, she would almost never actually
insert her vibrator. She was a clitoral-stimulation woman. The
buzz on her clit was all she needed or wanted to reach orgasm. The
vibrator fucking her of apparently it's own free will right now was
so distracting, and so very much not stimulating her clit that her
fast-approaching orgasm is now slipping away.

"Goddamn it. I'm hallucinating and _not_ cumming."

As if in response, she feels the scrunched folds of the cozy inch
up her vibrator, until there is a bulk of folds of yarn pressed against
her pussy. The yarn shifts and squeezes under her hand, and a small
part of it rubs its fuzzy warmness against her clit.

She gives in to this strange psychedelic experience and loosens her
grip, but continues to hold the cozied vibrator lightly, fearing that
if she let go reality would reassert itself and she would lose this
distinct feeling of being fucked by someone, or something.

Because she enjoys this being fucked. Loves it, in fact, now that she
is determined not to be freaked out by it — and now that she is 
getting her clit rubbed. The cozy pulses and squirms in her hand like
some kind of small burrowing mammal. And burrow it does, driving the vibe
into her pussy, over and over again in slow strokes. She can feel
the warm fur against her pussy, and the cold machine head piercing and
shaking inside her. And the loving finger of yarn stitches, piled onto
each other, and pressing and rubbing gently against her clit, creating a
rhythm with the shaking machine inside her.

Her eyes close. While she had been thinking about the dark-haired boy at
the train station before, now he is pushed out, as her mind fills with
some dark heavy cloud. It presses down on her, crushing her under its
atmospheric weight. But it is not a bad weight, it is like the weight of
a heavy comforter, keeping her warm in her bed on one of those days of
gray and cold pelting rain outside. The weight holds her, and comforts
her, and as it does, it fucks her, squeezing its soft yarn-body against
her, driving its appropriated tool into her.

Her mind wraps around the cloud, and her knees come together, squeezing
everything to her, and she cums with a wave of passion and gratitude for
this thing. It is an emotional orgasm, unlike any she had ever known
before.

As her orgasm flows past her and moves on, the movement between her
legs starts to slow, and the whole experience dissolves. When her eyes
open, she is holding her softly buzzing-fuzzy vibrator lightly against
the inside of her thigh, everything wet from her orgasm. From her eye a
small tear escapes and slips down the side of her temple.

----------------------------------------

The next day, she is knitting on the train home from work again. This
time there are two long tubes hanging down from her needles. Both tubes
dangle from the same set of needles, and she adds stitches to both of
them evenly, working across, so they grow symmetrically. A keen observer
would have seen her add a few inches worth of stitches just in the last
twenty minutes on the train. But there are no keen observers on this
train car today.

She's using the same warm yellow and blue yarn as the day before. She
has a lot of it, and she liked the way the cozy had looked. And, she
thought, perhaps there was something special about this yarn. Her tubes
are wider than the cozy tube was, even an experienced knitter might have
guessed they were socks this time. At first. But they are growing pretty
long, and socks are becoming increasingly less likely.

She knits with intense concentration. She wants to finish this project
before she gets home. Her needles clack away, and the train clacks on.
It screeches around her curve, jolts to its usual stop. She hops up,
and steps on the platform. She sees the dark-haired boy again, but he
is some way ahead of her today, already moving up the stairs off the
platform. He's out of the station before she even gets to the top of the
stairs.

She passes through the station and is out on the sidewalk on another
lovely cool spring day. She knits furiously as she walks. Perhaps paying
a little too close attention to her work; she stumbles over uneven bits
of sidewalk a couple of times before she gets home.

Inside she plops on the couch. Her cat leaps up and presses against
her, but she peers closely at her knitting through her glasses without
looking at him.

Finally she leans back and holds up the tube full-length, appraising it.
She decides it done enough, and pulling it close again goes to work
binding off. Clack clack clack-clack, and it's done. She leans back and
pets the cat, rubbing his head, and under his belly. He glowers angrily
at her knitting.

"Oh, don't be jealous. You'll always be my favorite fuzzy friend."

The cat seems unimpressed.

Back to her feet, she takes her new pieces and heads towards her room.
She had been thinking about this precise moment all day. Replaying the
experience with the cozy and the vibrator from the evening before, and
trying to keep some of the feeling of that intense orgasm within her.
She is pretty sure by now, that it must simply have been some kind of
strange manifestation of her mind — something she ate, or a symptom of
working too hard, or lack of sleep, or... something.

Her fingers find the bottom of her simple white shirt, and she pulls it
up and over her head. She drops it on one side of her bed, and slips her
arms behind her back to undo the clasp of her bra. Her arms slip out of
the straps and she drops it on top of her shirt on the floor.

She lays on her stomach on her bed, her blue paisley skirt draping
around her legs. She reaches into her bedside drawer, and pulls the
vibrator out, fully sheathed in its warm yellow cozy.

Her fingers find the button through the wool, and it springs to life her
in hand, buzzing like a tiny engine that could. She holds it for a short
while, then touches it lightly to her cheek, feeling it warming with
its movement, insulated by its fuzzy wool coat. It shows no signs of
behaving strangely right now.

She pops the switch off and tosses it to the side for a moment. She
rolls onto her back and picks up the two tubes of her new project.
Holding one end of the tube open, the fingers of her free hand point
together, and find their way into the tube. She slides it slowly up her
arm, checking the evenness of the stitching as the flow past her eye. She
pulls it until it is half-way up her upper arm, and her hand pops out the
other end. She waves her fingers, admiring her adorable new arm warmer.

She does the mirror version of the process, pulling the other arm warmer
up her other arm. The loose ends of threads dangle around her fingers.
She has not had time to weave them into the ends yet.

Still admiring her work, she crosses her arms across her chest. She likes
the way the warm yellow and blue colors stand out against her pale skin.
Her shoulders lift instinctively against the coolness of her room making
her little teacup breasts come together. Her nipples stand up pink and
proud in the cool air.

She slides the soft stitches of yarn against her body, enjoying the
feel of the warm wool on her bare skin. She looks at the vibrator, and
reaches over and picks it up. She whispers to the vibrator.

"Want to know a secret my little cozy friend? I didn't wear panties to
work today. And I was thinking about _you_ all day. About what you did
to me last night."

She slips the cozy down, exposing the tip of the vibrator. She touches
it to her tongue. And then pulls it back and looks at it tenderly.

"You made me so wet. I couldn't wait to get home and hold you in my
hand again."

She turns on the vibrator, and feels it again start to warm inside its
outerwear. Taking some of the material of her skirt in her hand, she
lifts it up, exposing some of her leg as it slips upwards. She gets it
just high enough to pass her cozied vibrator under. She imagines her
vibrator is someone special, the only someone she lets have access under
her skirts while everyone else has to just imagine what pleasures might
exist under there. She presses the tip of the vibrator to her clit, and
lets out a satisfied moan.

She starts as usual, with the vibrator humming sweetly against her clit,
and as usual can feel building seas of pleasure warming her spine. But
she remembers the thing fucking her last night — she _wants_ it to
fuck her again. So after a few minutes, she slips her vibrator down, and
pushes the tip between her wet pussy lips, which part and slip around
the end hungrily.

For a brief moment, she is gently fucking herself with her vibe. And
then she feels it twist in her hand again, the stitches of the cozy
contracting and shifting under her fingers. It squeezes, twists,
and jerks, and thrusts the length of the cold vibrating machine up
inside her. The cozy contracts and pulls, rubs fuzzily in her hand and
between her legs. It fucks her. With energy and force, like it has been
desperately waiting for this chance to push itself into her.

Her eyes close and her neck arches back. She reaches her free hand up
above her head, and grabs the headboard to steady herself and to ground
herself in reality. She feels the cozy in her hand back off a little,
and slow. It twists the vibrator inside her, and bunches together around
and between her fingers. It presses up against her clit and rubs her
slowly and with care.

She breathes carefully. She opens her eyes and looks down, her
yellow-warmered arm defining a bent line down around her pale breasts to
the pile of blue skirt. Her other arm, kinked at the elbow and above her
head, holding the headboard.

She relaxes, and spreads her legs, letting the thing fuck her. Her arm
above her head is not quite in the position it needs to be in. She
intends to bring it down to help move the skirts aside when she realizes
she cannot. She looks up at her hand, and the dangling threads of her
knitting have tied themselves around the posts of the headboard in
adorable little knots.

Without thinking too much about it, her free hand comes up from between
her legs, leaving the vibrator inside her, still fucking her slowly.
She picks at the knots with the fingers of her free hand, but as
she does so, she sees the dangling threads of that arm warmer wrap
repeatedly around the post of the headboard, and tie themselves tightly
in equivalently adorable knots.

Her instinct is to pull her arms away, but when she puts some effort
into that move, all the thousands of stitches of the arm warmers pull
tight. She feels a recursive electric current of fuzzy yarn loop around
and up her arms as her stitches tighten their grip on her. She brings
her elbows together, and pulls against the loops and knots with as much
strength as she can bring to it, pulling herself up the bed. As she does
this, she feels the stitches tighten more, and the vibrator and cozy
between her legs move faster, fucking her harder, as if the vibrator
were driving her up the bed with it's strokes.

Her knees squeeze together, as she rolls onto her side. The cozy between
her legs squirms and binds. It uses the inside of her thighs for
purchase, and from there, thrusts it's silicone appendage into her.
Her eyes close, and she pulls her arms against their ever-tightening
binds. And now the more she struggles, the harder the thing fucks her.

She wants to be fucked hard.

She lets out a scream. She twists and pulls against the blonde wood of
the headboard. The whole bed shakes and slips with the force with which
she is being fucked. Her back arches, her legs straighten. She resists.
And against every move she makes, the stitches respond, squeezing her
arms, grinding against her clit, pushing deeper inside her.

She resists again, and she is fucked harder. She resists more, and it
penetrates her with such force and vehemence that her eyes tear up.
But with the tears come the intensity of orgasm. This one comes on so
very quickly, she isn't really prepared for it. Her whole body squeezes
up like a dying bee, and she quivers helplessly as the orgasm passes
through her.

She's on her stomach now, her wrists cross at the headboard, and her
head droops down between her arms, her brown curls fall gently over her
shoulders. She feels the soft touch of her arm warmers on her cheeks.
Her eyes close, and her hips lift, her legs still clamp tightly around
the cozy between them. She struggles less now, and it fucks her more
slowly, as if with more care. The rows of stitches in the arm warmers
continually adjust, tightening and slackening. At one moment feeling
like firm hands pinning her down, and in the next comforting and loving
caresses that slide up her arms and over the points of her elbows.

The heavy cloud returns to her. But this time it isn't pressing down on
her, it passes over her and surrounds her. It's behind and above her.
She wants it inside her. She lifts her hips, and rises to her knees. She
gives it her body. She gives it her dripping pussy.

And it takes what is offered to it. She feels the vibrator grind into
her, shaking with some kind of renewed passion and force. The cozy no
longer has anything to press against, yet somehow with that freedom it
is able to fuck her even harder. It feels like some huge hirsute being,
made entirely of yarn with a silicone machine for a dick was behind her,
crushing its body against her, driving its warm furriness against her
clit and ass, and penetrating her with its robot cock.

Enormous hands grip her arms through the stitches of her arm warmers,
with fingers so big that they curl around both her upper arm and
forearms, sometimes clenching and painfully forcing her to straighten
her arms. Sometimes delicately caressing her, like she was a small and
deeply adored pet.

This time her orgasm approaches slowly and with caution, like its afraid
of what it might find if it arrives with this beast that grips her. But
the beastly thing seems to know exactly where her orgasm is, exactly
where it hides, and precisely which direction it approaches from. It
calls her orgasm out, and forces it to come to her.

She is being fucked now with long slow deliberate strokes. The body of
yarn presses against her clit with timing that takes her up a single
step towards some far off plateau with an altar of pleasure on it.
Slowly but surely rising. Her upper body is suspended from her bindings
to the headboard. Her ass rises and falls with each stroke. She grinds
her hips and her clit against her beast, wanting it to bring her orgasm
to her.

With time, she reaches the plateau. And there she stays, prostrate on
the peak, while her orgasm floods her body. Her breath is knocked from
her, her mouth open in a silent scream. She floats along this plateau of
pleasure, lost but never wanting to be found. Until finally it starts to
pass, letting the tension slip from her body.

She falls to the bed, warm air slowing finding its way back into her
lungs. She drifts slowly off to sleep, still wrapped in the tight
stitches of her arm warmers, still feeling that loving cozy between her
legs.

----------------------------------------

A week later she is once again knitting while riding the train home.
This time it is a dense swatch of yarn, about the length and width of
her hand. She has knitted it in three layers of a soft gray merino wool
that had been delivered to her house a couple of days ago. Extending out
from each end of the swatch are two long braided lines. She finishes and
binds off before the train even arrives at her station.

She walks quickly home, with a look of eager excitement on her face.
Though around her eyes are thin lines of exhaustion. At her door waits
three plain brown boxes. She picks them up. They are very light, so she
balances them on one arm while she fumbles her apartment door open.

The cat leaps over a skein of yarn and comes up to her, brushing his
scent on her legs. She leans down and pets his head while dropping the
boxes next to her couch.

The couch has more boxes on it, most of which are opened, and from
them spills yarn in arrays of colors. Some with the subtle rich
quality of hand-dyed yarn, and some with the vibrant unnatural quality
of industrial nylon, and everything in between. Yarn is draped in loose
loopy piles over the back of the couch. And pyramidal piles of balls
of yarn dot the floor. Long thin lines of yarn stretch from one of the
boxes on the floor up to the yarn swift standing upright from her coffee
table. And other lines run to her ball winder on the other end of the
coffee table. Skeins of yarn are stacked on the table, the couch, on the
boxes, on the floor; in every open space available to her.

Knitted projects in various states of completion are scattered about,
with trailer lines running off to the balls she was knitting from.
There's long scarf-like things, small fingerless gloves, socks without
toes, ropes of various widths created by knitting and braiding, and
intricately weaved and knitted but unidentifiable projects. Most of the
projects are still on the needles. There are many needles stuck into
balls and skeins and half-finished projects giving the warm fuzzy look
of all that yarn a distinctly prickly appearance.

As she moves around her living room she kicks balls out of the way and
the cat, when he can be bothered, bounds after them. She takes her new
project with her as she heads towards her bedroom. She stops before the
closed door, and carefully undoes her bra and pulls it from under her
blouse and drops it on the floor. She slips her blouse over her head,
and slips her skirt and panties down to her ankles, and steps from her
shoes and clothes. She takes off a thin silver bracelet and drops it on
the piles of clothes. Now completely naked, she enters.

Her bedroom is very dim. She doesn't open the shades any more. Like her
living room there is yarn and knitted projects everywhere. But while
her living room has managed appearance of a project worked on with
intensity, her bedroom has the chaotic appearance of some disastrous
explosion of yarn.

Thick lines of yarn droop in big loops across the space of the room,
hanging from hooks installed in the walls and ceiling. Delicate webs
of knitted and tied yarn stretch across and above the bed. The arm
warmers she knitted a week ago hang suspended in the middle of the
room, twisting in the slight breeze from her opening of the door. Other
more mysterious knitted projects have joined them. In some places there
appear to be scarves many feet longer than they should be, wrapped
around each other, and then unwinding up into dark corners of the room.

The yarns are spliced, twisted, stitched, and knotted with every shade
of color; without regard for rhyme or reason or color theory. Bright
pinks are wrapped with vile clashing yellows. Browns with blues.
And so very many shades of red, all just one disturbingly close but
not-quite-matching shade from the next nearest red. In many places she
continued a project mid-row with whatever yarn happened to be closest at
hand.

She moves carefully into the room, bowing under and stepping over loops
that cross her path, until she reaches her arm warmers in nearly the
center of the room. She drops her newest project silently on the floor,
and takes up a wide knitted tube that hangs with the arm warmers. She
slips her fingers into the bottom, and lifts it over her head and pulls
it down, feeling the yarn brush over her face, over her breasts and her
erect nipples. She pulls it down over her torso. It covers her stomach,
from her hip bones to just under her breasts.

This torso tube is knitted with tight, dense stitching and is mostly
made of a baby blue colored cotton yarn, except for a couple of inches
where she ran short on the bottom and used a navy yarn. Long thick lines
run from it, to the dark corners of her room extending like insect
legs from her sides. She slips into her arm warmers, and then leans
over to pull on similar leg warmers that she slides up to her knees
until her feet pop out of the far ends. Attached to the arm warmers and
the leg warmers is a whole web of different color yarns that run off
in different directions in the room, and as she moves the lines pull
and react in complicated ways, so that a movement of her arm triggers
movements of different lines and cables of yarn suspended from many
different places in the room.

She leans over again, and this time lifts her new project, and places it
over her eyes, and ties the strings that extend from it behind her head.

"Ok, my friend. I'm ready."

She says this out loud to the room, her voice oddly muffled by all the
soft surface area of the yarn that absorbs it. She leans backwards, as
if she intends to flop onto her bed.

But as her body moves, all the yarn in the room suddenly gains tension.
There's a swift swishing sound as the lines pull taut. She feels
everything in the room move at once, from the big ropey lines supporting
her weight, down to the tiny interlocking stitches pressed against her
skin.

She rests in mid-air, suspended above her bed by the network of yarn
slicing around the room. It holds her, and at the same time it caresses
her. She feels its touch through the stitches on her arms, her legs,
her stomach. It feels as if her weight is held in its giant hand, and
it contemplates her like Yorick's skull. Hundreds of strings and lines
of yarn, ranging from individual strands up to thick knitted cables now
move on her. She is wrapped by long meaty loops that move around her
legs, and her arms, and her neck; and thin little strings that slip
between her fingers. A loop circles her hair and pulls it gently into a
pony tail, and it lifts to supports her head.

She hangs quietly and meditatively for a while, feeling the caress of
the yarn, gently tightening and loosening, and sliding over her body. It
feels along her body. And as it feels her, she feels it. She can feel
its affection through the way the yarn touches her. The caresses slide
up and down her arms, her legs, between her fingers, and around her
neck.

She can feel all the different textures of the different yarns. The
scratchy itch of cheap wool, and the smooth toughness of nylon and
polyester strings. In places there's even some slick and soft rayon and
silk. And she's sure she can tell just by the touch of it, that her
foot has been wrapped in a small scarf she made of an extremely fine
cashmere.

But the thing doesn't just want to hold her.

A rope of yarn as thick as her thumb slowly circles her upper thigh.
She feels each coil laying down and rising up her leg in a spiral. As
each coil comes down, it tightens. As it moves up her thigh, the strings
and lines of the room contract, her leg warmers are pulled towards the
walls, and her legs are forced apart.

The coils reach the top of her thigh and a loop passes between her legs
and lays down across her pussy, and then loops up and over her hip, and
comes down tightening over her ass. Another loop lays down on her pussy,
and another circling over her other hip.

She is almost completely cocooned in yarn. The lines between her legs,
tighten, squeezing her whole hip, ass, and pelvis in its grip. The yarn
presses against her clit moves on its own, twisting and slipping over
her, pressing and grinding its fingers of yarn against her with a rhythm
that seems to know it will make her cum.

She lets a long soft moan escape, and as she does the torso tube
constricts. Her breaths become short and shallow. The loop of yarn
around her hair pulls downwards, and her head falls back, her neck
exposed, like the white underbelly of a creature from the pelagic. Her
neck too is then wrapped in loop after loop of colors. Her whole body
is squeezed in its giant warm grip, and the grip of its fingers squeeze
against her clit.

She is crushed by its force. If before it was a giant standing behind
her, now it grown so huge that she fits entirely in its massive fist.
And it squeezes her in its fist like the control mechanism of some
monstrous machine.

It squeezes the air out of her. It squeezes the moisture out of her. It
squeezes her orgasm out of her. She cums powerfully, thrusting her hips
against the squeeze, short bursts of loud pleasure pushed from her lips.

But the thing is not done with her.

Her knees are bent upwards forcing her to a fetal position. Her arms are
pulled behind her, and crossed, and bound by yet more loops of knitted
yarn (scarves she's knitted, she is fairly sure). An afghan she knitted
years ago now circles around her entirely, curling her up and
encasing her in a womb of yarn.

Down the back of her thigh, through the layers of yarn, she feels
something moving. It shakes with a frequency she knows well. The thing
has found her vibrator, and within the grip of the thing, is slowly
running it along her leg, touching her ass with it, touching her
wherever it likes with it, as if to communicate that she is completely
powerless in its grip.

She feels the loops around her pussy, ass, and hips loosen very
slightly. The tip of it presses gently between the coils of yarn over
her pussy, and touches her clit gently. Her wrappings clamp down around
her. She can feel yarn moving and tightening over every inch of her
skin. Her pussy soaks in anticipation of being fucked. Because that's
all she wants now that she is so firmly encased. She wants to be fucked
by her lover.

The vibrator slips wetly into her pussy. The thing has become a massive
arachnid, with its prey wrapped for a meal. It penetrates her with its
quivering poisonous tooth. She feels the tips of its many legs poking
her and prodding her repeatedly and quickly all over her body. And that
hard quaking tooth pierces and bites its way inside her.

The poison floods her, and a warm pleasure fills her. Her whole body
writhes and contracts, but once again her struggles result in being
fucked harder. Another orgasm comes to her, but this time without the
touching of her clit. This orgasm comes from pure penetration. She feels
like that's all she is, balled up in this wrap of yarn — she is just a
thing to be penetrated by this enormous many-legged beast that toys with
her. The vibrator shakes and pumps in and out of her sopping pussy.

She is warm and can barely breathe. Her muscles scream to stretch out.
But she knows she is the prey now, and this thing wants to feed on her.
And it feeds for hours. It pumps its tooth in and out of her while she
sit barely on the edge of consciousness, and on the edge of orgasm.

Her orgasm eventually slides into her, passing in a wave from her pussy
up her back and over her shoulders and neck. She shakes uncontrollably,
telegraphing a message of pleasure through the entire web of the room.

And the thing finally relents. It relaxes, and unwinds the loops of
yarn, unspooling around her legs, and slips her gently down to the bed.

She falls asleep cooling slowly in the wraps of her lover.

----------------------------------------

Now her whole life becomes knitting. She has called in absent to work
and used up most of her amassed vacation days. She sees few people,
except the package delivery guy, who drops off boxes of yarn nearly
every day on her porch.

She knits for hours each day, and then spends her evenings wrapped in
her work, as it works on her. She knits nearly a project a day. She
looks for patterns that she can use. Things that might contribute to
what the thing her room can and will do with her. She has knit mittens
and socks, shawls and blankets, headbands and garters. And every item is
given to the thing in her room.

And every item it takes, and makes its own. It never goes quite as she
plans. She knit a lovely lace cropped halter top of a soft and undyed
wool thinking it would tickle and tempt her nipples — a way for the
thing to touch her breasts gently and with care. Instead it somehow
ended up with dozens of knitting needles sticking through it, and when
she wore it, the thing dug the needles into her chest and breast while
she came. Her left nipple had been pinched tightly between two needles,
and she had screamed with pain. Though as if it knew her better than
herself, her orgasm has been so intense, she couldn't stand for hours
afterwards.

A thin scarf she had knit became a whip used across the back of her bare
legs, leaving red stripes that she secretly admired while looking back
over her shoulder into the mirror in the bathroom the next day.

Even a simple pair of socks, that she had knit just because she actually
could use a new pair of socks, it had taken and gripped her feet and
ankles tightly with, and held her upside down while forcing thick loops
of yarn between her legs, tightening them until she came.

And her blindfold, that she had enjoyed the first time she tried it,
had on recent evenings taken to slipping down and around her neck, and
tightening and squeezing, especially when she was about to cum.

She loved knitting of course. It completely fulfilled her, in a
meditative way. And pairing that fulfillment with the orgasmic way the
thing in her room fulfilled her made her feel like she needed nothing
more from life. But she knew not everything in the room were things that
she had made. There were other, scarier, things in there that she is
not sure where they came from. Thick braided roping lines bristling
with steel knitting needles. Complex webbed things that sometimes would
entrap her face, and tighten around her head. And crochet hooks, that
were used in all the creative and vicious ways a little boy might use
them. Where had they come from? She hated crocheting, and was pretty
sure she didn't have any crochet hooks before the thing came to her
room.

She didn't know what else might be in there. There were dark corners to
that room, with the blinds perpetually drawn, where new surprises might
be hiding.

But now the thing seemed to know her, surely better than any person had
ever known her. It could not just make her cum, it could _control_ her
orgasms. It knew how to play her like she was the cherished instrument
of a virtuoso. Her lust for the thing was boundless. If it weren't for
the chance to sit quietly and knit, she would never leave the room.

But it wasn't just lust. She did crave the orgasms from it, but it also
conveyed a sense of affection for her. It would hold her for the entire
night after making her cum repeatedly. It would caress and wrap her. It
would warm her when she was cold, and it would open its wrappings to let
her cool when she was hot. It always seemed to know precisely what would
make her more comfortable — when it was willing to let her be more
comfortable.

And sometimes it was even playful. It would bind her up lightly, and
then ever-so-lightly run felted and fuzzed whispy cheap yarns across the
bottom of her feet. It would tickle her.

She was, in fact, falling in love with it.

----------------------------------------

She spent weeks in her world of yarn. Nothing else was worth much
consideration. In a funny way this was exactly what she had always
wanted knitting to be. She had often had the thought that she loved
knitting so much that if she could figure out a way to make a living at
it she could quit her job and do nothing else but knit. Now she had all
but quit her job, and she had done nothing but knit for weeks. And all
she wanted was more.

On this, her last day with the thing in her room, she was knitting in
the round on circular needles. Like crochet hooks, she had always seen
circular needles the way a small boy might — as some kind of exotic
weapon. With two short, straight metal needles wired together with a loop
of strong, stiff nylon, they looked like something a ninja would use to
silently garrote an enemy. But they were much easier for knitting in the
round than using three straight needles.

She knits vigorously, loose stitches of a thin dark yarn. Within minutes
it takes shape: a circular strip three inches wide. With the circular
needles still threaded through it, she pulls it over her head and
down around her neck. She is naked, except for this choker she is now
wearing.

She stands and walks towards the bedroom. The cat bounds away. He has
taken to hiding every time she opens the bedroom door. She passes the
hallway mirror, and likes the look of the dark yarn of the choker
against the pale skin of her neck. She's lost weight, she has more
points and angles and lines across her body now, where the bones show
themselves through her skin.

This choker idea is not a smart one, and she knows it. Her experiences
with the thing lately have taken dark turns. She did not blame it. Her
lover was an extension of herself. They worked together to see how far
they could go, to try new things, to see what she could achieve if
she let it unleash all of what seemed to be its limitless strength on
her. But she also taunted and teased it sometimes. And this choker was
clearly taunting. It was a plea to ask the thing to take risks with her,
and to trust that it could control itself.

Deep down she knew asking humans to control themselves was a nearly
ridiculous expectation. How much more so for the presence of an
undefinable identity?

She stands before the door of her bedroom. Individual strands of yarn
are already snaking under the door and softly wrapping her feet. She
opens the door and looks into the room where it is completely dark and
muffled in silence. She doesn't even step in, she just leans in, and
immediately she is wrapped. Wrapped in her scarves, her socks, her
blankets, her arm and leg warmers. She's wrapped in heavy coils of her
knitwear, thousands of yarns and hundreds of thousands of her stitches
all linking together and consuming her. She's wrapped in the affection
and love of her soft-sinewy beast.

All of these pieces of hers have come together, knitted together of
their own will by who-knows-what force. They form into a single giant
coil as thick as her torso which circles around her, binding her legs
together, around her hips, her abdomen, compressing her breasts to her
chest, binding one arm to her side and the other across her belly. The
coil wraps little tendrils into her choker and the thinner end of the
great coil circles slowly over her eyes. The thing lifts her up, and as
if for no reason than to demonstrate to her that it could do anything it
wants with her, presses her up against the ceiling.

This time the thing has taken the form of some antediluvian serpent god,
constructed of the works of her own hand, of the materials that had
slipped between her fingers, an inch at a time. The coils constrict with
love and care, so much love and care that it squeezes all motion and
conviction from her. She loves the thing, and wants to show her how much
she loves it by accepting whatever it wants to do with her.

The constricting coil inches along her, a ripple of power sliding
around and up her body like a chain being taken up. The coils retract
and constrict as they adjust for a better grip on her small body. The
softness of the yarn on the surface of the coil is compressed under
something hard that moves like powerful muscles. Her knitting that
always felt so delicate and gentle in her hands has become something
thick and powerful in the possession of this monster.

One of the coils wraps around and under her ass. From this two thick
wands protrude, hemipenes of heavy felted yarn, studded with protruding
knitting needles and the ends of sharp crochet hooks around their bases.
The coils around her legs twist, and her body bends exposing her ass and
pussy. The dual protrusions of felted and spiked wool have become as
thick as her wrists and as long as her forearms, each writhing of its
own accord along the exposed white skin of the back of her legs.

One forces itself into the narrow gap between her legs, prying her
apart like some shellfish against the force of the coils constricting
her legs together. She can feel it twisting and thrusting between her
legs, making headway until it passes out the other side. It stiffens and
thickens, as if filled from within by some moving mass of heavy yarn.
The other protrusion writhes and spits, like an old frayed hawser broken
under tension, leaving red streaks across the white curve of her ass.

Now she is cracked open, her pussy exposed, one giant rope of yarn
between her legs and the other flaying her ass wildly. She groans aloud
with anticipation and desire. She speaks to the thing, begging it to
fuck her. She tells it of her love for it, and how she wants to feel
the thing inside her. The thing itself, with it's pure knitted warm
wooliness, not with a cold vibrating tool this time.

The rope striking her ass slows, and twists, and comes softly around
under the curve of her ass. The tip finds her pussy and presses against
it. A ripple passes through the coils of soft-muscled wool constricting
her body, as if to create a better position to fuck her with. It makes
adjustments, it bends her further at the waist. And then it enters
her, pushing it's long thick rope of yarn deep up her pussy, until the
needles and hooks at the base of the protrusions press sharply into the
sensitive skin of her ass and the backs of her legs.

It fucks her. Slowly driving in and out with one of the protrusions
while the other comes up between her legs and grinds against her clit.
She is held aloft on these two spikes of wool, wrapped in the tender
constricting coils of her lover. It fucks her with slow force, and
crushes her with heavy force at the same time. She feels the hooks
scraping her legs, the points of the knitting needles walking across her
ass with each grinding thrust. The coils around her wring her like a wet
cloth, and the heavy cocks of her lover pierce her like an awl through
leather.

With only the shallowest of breaths available to her, she fights for
consciousness. With her eyes closed under a coil of yarn, she sees
nothing but black with white glowing around the edges. Her orgasm is
incredibly slow to come, but the thing seems to know just how to raise
it, slowly but surely as if summoning it from some lower dimension of
hell. And as it manifests, the coils around her pulse and convulse,
the cocks in her pussy and between her legs grind deep into her and
hold themselves there, as if the thing too is experiencing an orgasm
coinciding with her own — as if it experiences _her_ orgasm.

As the wave of hot pleasure travels up her spine, and reaches her neck,
she feels the choker entwined with the coils of yarn about her tighten.
A wave of constriction flows up the coils beginning from the lowest
ones around her ankles and up her legs and over her body. When the wave
reaches her neck, the coil of nylon built into the circular-needle
constricts around her neck. Her lover sinks its fangs of steel into her
neck, and she loses consciousness.

----------------------------------------

She regains consciousness to find herself laying on her bed, one of her
blankets draped over her, along with a few interwoven lines of yarn
resting like the arm of a lover across her shoulder. She quietly rises
and leaves the room, closing the door behind her.

On her kitchen table among other craft tools are a large pair of shears.
Longer than the length of her hand, with steel blades wider than two
of her fingers together, and heavy brass handles. They were made in
India, and she had picked them up at an imports gift store years ago
just because she liked the way they looked like they had been made in a
previous century. She picks them up, and is fortified by the weight of
them.

She walks back into the bedroom, and picks up a scarf that rests on the
floor. The heavy sharp blades of the scissors slice through her stitches
with almost no effort at all. In two moves of her hand she has cut the
entire way across the scarf, cleaving it to pieces. As she lets the two
ends of the scarf fall to the ground, she picks up one of her knitted
arm warmers from the bed and slices them the long way up the tube. All
around her the materials of her work spring to life, tension fills all
the lines of the room as they draw taught against their various hooks,
connection points, and knots.

She begins cutting furiously. She slices along the middle of her crafts
and pulls the stitching apart with her fingers. She takes individual
yarns in her hand and yanks them watching the loops flit away like a
shooed swarm of small flying insects, and then loops the yarn over her
finger and slices through big bunches with one cut of her shears.

The lines around the room flex and tension in protest, but the manor of
their movement is more like a plea with her to stop than an effort to
prevent her from what she is doing. A delicate scarf of cashmere softly
caresses her leg. She picks it up and slices it in half, but not
without tears in her eyes.

She works continuously without slowing for an hour, cutting away with
determination this thing that had taken over her life and its binds
that held her to it. She reduces all the work in the room to threads no
longer than her finger. And when it is done the bedroom is covered in
piles of confettied yarn that no longer move of their own volition.
That no longer have any power over her.
