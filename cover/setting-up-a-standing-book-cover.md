# Instructions for setting up a standing-book cover using template


1
Start by making a black and white image in gimp, which you then colorize.
To make it the right color:
	- First, make it b+w:
		- Use color->components->decompose and select (probably) the green channel. Do this BEFORE you add an alpha layer and cut out the transparent background in the next step.
	- Cut out your image, if necessary: 
		- (Select layer->transparency->add alpha channel. Then when you cut stuff out (with the fuzzy select tool or whatever) you will have a transparent background.)
	- Then, Make sure you are in Image->Mode->RGB mode, and use colors->colorize.  Set Hue at 360 and Saturation at 100. Lightness at 0, to get a rich maroon-red color
		- (Seems like either the scale for these settings changed to a scale of 0-1 in more recent version of gimp, or the scale is set somewhere and I don't know where. In the most recent attempt, I used these settings: Hue: 1.0, Sat: 1.0, lightness: 0) 
	- Save it as a png, prob with a transparent background. You might want to crop it to the 926x1630 aspect ratio mentioned in the next step, but you don't have to.

2
Design a cover in inkscape. Make it square, 2000px x 2000px for the
square cover template. (This will fit nicely on the book mockup in
gimp.) Use 926 wide by 1630 high for the 5x8 template.

The typeface used for previous covers was Gentium Book. On arch linux, this
requires installing an AUR package with the gentium fonts

Save it as a .png.

Get one of these templates from this guy: 
	https://covervault.com/tag/square/
	https://covervault.com/5-x-8-paperback-book-mockup-with-fewer-pages/	
	https://covervault.com/5-5-x-8-paperback-mockup/	
	(Or use copy of gimp-saved version in template dir.)
Open a new copy of the standing book template file in gimp.
Open your cover design png as another tab in gimp. Drag that layer to
the standing book tab and drop it on the image to add that as a layer.
Move it below the cover masking layer and above the Book White layer

4
In gimp use the Perspective tool to shape your cover layer to fit on
the slant of the cover of the mockup book.

5
For the square cover, with the rounded corners:
Use fuzzy select (threshold around 10) on the gray area of the Book White
layer. This will give you the shape of the cover. Switch to your cover
design layer, select->inverse and delete. This will crop your design
cover to fit directly on the standing book template cover. (Clip those
rounded corners, mostly.) (It might look like you can skip this step if you
have white edges - but it will work better if you do it.)

6
On a white-background cover you need to do something to show where the
edge of the book cover is. One option is to go back to the Book White
layer, fuzzy select the gray cover again, and then do Select->shrink
by 5 px. Switch to your cover layer and again invert the selection and
delete. This will give you a 5px line (showing the gray from the Book
White layer around your cover design.)

Another thing that might help here is copying the mask from the
template and pasting it to your layer:
- In the layer where you have the mask you are willing to copy choose
“Mask to Selection” (Layer > Mask > Mask to Selection in menu or just
right click on the layer)
- In the layer where you want to copy the mask choose “Add Layer Mask”
and choose “Selection” in the menu.
This should automatically crop the image to the cover size.

7
Another option with the square cover is to adjust the shade laid over
your cover. The cover masking layer is just a black fill on the standing
book cover, with the opacity adjusted. Down around 15% seems right for a
shade to make the cover stand out, but play with it.

With the 5x8 cover, you can turn off the default image layer, and then
just lower the opacity of your cover image so a bit of the gray blank
book cover comes through. This can make a bright white cover look
a little more photographed.

8
Crop the image down so it is just bigger than the cover. (You want it
to be as big as possible on Amazon.)

9
Save it as a Tiff for Amazon.
(Uncompressed. It will fail if compressed.)
Save it as a .png for compiling as an ebook with pandoc.
